# Harry Hare

## Overview
A 2D platformer Metroidvania featuring Harry Hare. Your goal is to the key to the large door in the starting room. You do so by exploring various rooms filled with traps and enemies.
Sometimes you'll find roadblocks which prevent your progress, but thankfully with enough exploration you'll be able to find some power-ups that'll allow you to pass.

## Controls
To move, use the A and D keys on your keyboard to move to either the left or right respectively and jump with SPACE. Once you find the first power-up, the double-jump, you'll be able to jump again by pressing SPACE in mid-air.
Once you obtain the air-dash power-up, press SHIFT to trigger it once in mid-air to gain more air time, allowing for longer horizontal jumps.

## Obstacles
On the way you'll find enemies such as snails and bees. These hurt you upon contact from the front or back, but you can defeat them by jumping on them, which also grants you some air time.
These reduce your health by 1, and when you lose all health, it's game over! Spikes are another type of obstacle you should be careful of, these actually instantly kill you.
Thankfully, you can find checkpoint flags so that you wouldn't have to lose too much progress. You can also collect carrots to replenish your health.
